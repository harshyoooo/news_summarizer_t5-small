Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\n\"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\"\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said.\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.\n\nPredicted Summary:\n Prison leavers in Wales could be on the streets for six months without a lot of help, charity says.\n\n--- Article 2 ---\nOriginal:\n summarize: Officers searched properties in the Waterfront Park and Colonsay View areas of the city on Wednesday.\nDetectives said three firearms, ammunition and a five-figure sum of money were recovered.\nA 26-year-old man who was arrested and charged appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday.\n\nPredicted Summary:\n A man has appeared in court charged with firearms offences in Edinburgh.\n\n--- Article 3 ---\nOriginal:\n summarize: Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, all 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24, appeared in a Chicago court on Friday.\nThe four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things.\nAn online fundraiser for their victim has collected $51,000 (Â£42,500) so far.\nDenying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: \"Where was your sense of decency?\"\nProsecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor.\nPolice allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune.\nThe court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt.\nIn a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump.\nThe victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December.\nHe was found by a police officer on Tuesday, 3 January, a day after he was reported missing by his parents.\nProsecutors say the suspects each face two hate crimes counts, one because of the victim's race and the other because of his disabilities.\n\nPredicted Summary:\n A three-year-old man has been charged with aggravated kidnapping and aggravated battery after a beating in a van.\n\n--- Article 4 ---\nOriginal:\n summarize: The 48-year-old former Arsenal goalkeeper played for the Royals for four years.\nHe was appointed youth academy director in 2000 and has been director of football since 2003.\nA West Brom statement said: \"He played a key role in the Championship club twice winning promotion to the Premier League in 2006 and 2012.\"\n\nPredicted Summary:\n West Brom have appointed a former Manchester United goalkeeper to the club's youth academy.\n\n--- Article 5 ---\nOriginal:\n summarize: Restoring the function of the organ - which helps control blood sugar levels - reversed symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments.\nThe study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body.\nExperts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease.\nThe experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\".\nWhen people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet.\nIt resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day.\nThen they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine.\nPrevious research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing.\nBut animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell.\nThese are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high.\nDr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\"\nThere were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments.\nType 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin.\nFurther tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects.\nDr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes.\n\"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\"\nBBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo.\nHe said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs).\n\"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight.\n\"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\"\nHis blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers.\nHe said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\"\nPeter Bowes: Fasting for science\nPeter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body\nSeparate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why.\nHowever, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet.\nHe told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\"\nHe said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance.\nDr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes.\n\"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.\n\nPredicted Summary:\n The \"fasting-mimicking\" diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas, a study has found.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(outputs)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-23T13:19:11.500634Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-23T13:19:11.500911Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-23T13:19:11.505484Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-23T13:19:11.500892Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-23T13:19:11.504954Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"tf.Tensor(\n[[    0 27344  1175    52     7    16 10256   228    36    30     8  6162\n     21  1296   767   406     3     9   418    13   199     6  7813   845\n      5     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0    71   388    65  4283    16  1614  4977    28 20507     7 10883\n   2319    16 16504     5     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0\n      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0    71   386    18  1201    18  1490   388    65   118  4977    28\n      3 31540    26  4984    29     9  5341    11     3 31540    26  3322\n    227     3     9 16201    16     3     9  4049     5     1     0     0]\n [    0  1244  4027    51    43  7817     3     9  1798  9145   907  1288\n  10477    12     8  1886    31     7  4192 25990     5     1     0     0\n      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0]\n [    0    37    96 11584    53    18    51   603  3142    53   121  3178\n      3    60 29955     3     9   534   686    13  2358    16     8  2131\n   5045     9     7     6     3     9   810    65   435     5     1     0]], shape=(5, 36), dtype=int32)\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model.save_pretrained(\"t5_model\")\ntokenizer.save_pretrained(\"t5_model\")\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-23T13:22:48.327184Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-23T13:22:48.327984Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-23T13:22:49.357132Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-23T13:22:48.327952Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-23T13:22:49.356496Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":19,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"('t5_model/tokenizer_config.json',\n 't5_model/special_tokens_map.json',\n 't5_model/spiece.model',\n 't5_model/added_tokens.json',\n 't5_model/tokenizer.json')"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import shutil\nshutil.make_archive(\"news_summarizer_t5\", 'zip', \"t5_model\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-23T13:27:51.577399Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-23T13:27:51.577949Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-23T13:28:13.911401Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-23T13:27:51.577921Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-23T13:28:13.910598Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":21,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'/kaggle/working/news_summarizer_t5.zip'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!zip -r t5_model1.zip t5_model","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-23T13:29:46.795337Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-23T13:29:46.795942Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-23T13:30:11.541890Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-23T13:29:46.795909Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-23T13:30:11.541130Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"  adding: t5_model/ (stored 0%)\n  adding: t5_model/tokenizer.json (deflated 74%)\n  adding: t5_model/spiece.model (deflated 48%)\n  adding: t5_model/config.json (deflated 63%)\n  adding: t5_model/tf_model.h5","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.
